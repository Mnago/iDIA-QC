iDIA-QC is a Python Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a suite of analytical tools enabling comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the quality of mass spectrometry-based DIA files. The software incorporates the protein qualitative and quantitative algorithms from DIA-NN and uses msConvert for file conversion to extracted precursor ion chromatogram (PIC). Based on 15 metrics extracted from the DIA files, which describe the characteristics of the raw files from timsTOF serial instruments, TripleTOF instruments, and Orbitrap serial instruments, we utilize machine learning models to predict the quality of the DIA files. The outputs of iDIA-QC in a longitudinal summary, visually display the quality of the DIA files. Additionally, it promptly shares the prediction results and visualization with administrators via email.
